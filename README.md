We implemented the digital alarm clock that displays time in hours, minutes and seconds, and also the real
date. The objective of our project is to implement all the basic functions of the digital clock which we find
inour daily life routine.The features like 24 hour display, date display, clock setting,date display, alarm
setting. We have also added the feature of room
temperature display. If the room temperature goes beyond a certain threshold then the buzzer goes of
showing a higher uneasy temperature of room. The designed 24 hour digital clock retains its real time
using DS 1307 RTC's backup reachareable battery. Arduino board with its development IDE and 16x2
LCD displays was used. The date,time,and temperature will be displayed on the LCD
display panel. This report
outlines the processes involved in executing the project. Thus the digital clock was
constructed and results were obtained.
The 24 hour digital clock was design using Arduino which contains Atmega328p microcontroller and was
programmed using Arduino's development IDE.
The power supply is the USB port. The clock is configured by programming the Arduino with DS1307
RTC.
The time in hours, minutes and seconds, and temperautre will be displayed on the LCD displays panel.
The system is implemented by a program written in Arduino's IDE. The
program file is then uploaded into the Arduino board.
